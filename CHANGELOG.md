## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- The proxy forwards a batched Produce (`tansu.batch=true`) with the strictest `acks` among the batched requests, and at least `acks=1`, so the origin answers it. Upgrade proxies before brokers: an older proxy forwards batches with `acks=0` and waits for a response that an upgraded broker no longer sends.
- Known limitation: the proxy still waits for a response to an `acks=0` Produce that it passes through unbatched. Against an upgraded broker, that request stalls until the broker's connection idle timeout closes the upstream connection.
- A listener with SASL configured closes a connection that sends a frame larger than 512KiB before the client authenticates, matching the Apache Kafka default for `sasl.server.max.receive.size`. The same limit applies while a client re-authenticates. The broker logs this rejection as `PreAuthenticationFrameTooBig`, and counts it in `nisshi_frames_rejected`.

### Security

- Decoding a produce batch is bounded. Previously a few KB of compressed
  data could decompress into gigabytes, and a record carrying millions of
  empty headers expanded 32x on decode. Now a batch is rejected with
  `MESSAGE_TOO_LARGE` once its decompressed bytes, or its decoded records
  and headers, pass a 100 MiB budget, or up front when its `record_count`
  alone would. A producer can recover by splitting the batch (the Java
  producer does this on its own for a batch of more than one record).
- Peak memory while decoding one batch is a small multiple of that budget
  (roughly 2 to 3x), not 100 MiB exactly:
  - an uncompressed record's headers are charged after they are allocated,
    so the record that crosses the budget can add up to about 100 MiB more;
  - a Snappy batch holds its decompressed block (up to 100 MiB) alongside
    the records decoded from it;
  - zstd's decoder window, up to 128 MiB, sits outside the budget.
  The budget applies per batch; concurrent batches each have their own.

### Fixed

- A Snappy batch with a truncated xerial header is rejected with an error
  instead of panicking the decoder.
- SlateDB compaction skips a stored batch it cannot inflate, with a warning,
  instead of abandoning the whole maintenance pass.
- The broker no longer writes a Produce response for an `acks=0` request. A storage or validation failure on an `acks=0` Produce now closes the connection (matching Apache Kafka) instead of silently dropping the batch.
