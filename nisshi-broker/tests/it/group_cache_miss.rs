//! A group request that finds no cached state for its group starts from an
//! empty group with no version. The storage's conditional write has to
//! reject that as outdated and hand back the stored group, or the request
//! drops every member (`UnknownMemberId`) or fails with a storage error.
//!
//! The coordinator finds nothing cached in two ways:
//!
//! - two requests for the same group overlap on the broker: while the first
//!   is writing the group back to storage, the second finds its cached state
//!   checked out;
//! - the broker restarts: a new coordinator over the same storage has
//!   nothing cached.
